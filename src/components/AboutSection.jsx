                    I recently graduated with a Computer Science degree from UVic and have hands-on experience with React, Node.js, and database technologies through coursework and personal projects. I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect of development and strive to write clean, readable code.

                    When I'm not studying or coding, I love playing soccer, diving into games, exploring hiking trails, and fishing.

                    Currently focusing on full-stack web development, I'm always excited to take on new challenges
                    and collaborate with teams that value quality and innovation.
